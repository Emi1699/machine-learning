 You don't even have to upload your shorts from a smartphone or an iPhone, you can actually upload your shorts from a computer, a laptop, or a MacBook, and today's video I will guide you through the process. Hey everyone, Andrew Morrison here, welcome to my channel. Here on my channel, I help brand new and already existing entrepreneurs, business owners, coaches, consultants, and course creators to turn a YouTube channel into an online education business that can grow in scale to six and seven figures. Subscribe to the bell and the like button below. And let's get into the video now. Now in order to actually upload your shorts on your computer, your laptop, or your MacBook, you first and foremost need to make sure that your shorts was filmed vertically in vertical mode. And you also need to make sure that the dimensions are set correctly 1080 by 1920. And then you can either send your shorts video either from your phone to your computer, or you can also simply edit that shorts video on your computer as well. Again, set in the right dimensions. Now in order to upload the shorts, you obviously go to YouTube Studio and then you go to camera icon where it says create. And I will guide you through the process you go to upload video. And I am using today a video that I actually already put up on my channel recently, all to actually how to make a YouTube short video. And so we will use that for example, purposes you drag and drop as I just showed you. So first and foremost, the title is really important, especially when it comes to YouTube because it is a search engine. And you want to first make sure that you do have hashtag shorts in your title as well. So again, title is very important. And then moving next to description, the description you also need to ensure that you have shorts also hashtag as well. And then you can just simply copy and paste description like I just did so as well. And then going down next, you can either do a custom thumbnail. I use Canva by the way for all my thumbnails or you can also use a thumbnail from your video actually from your shorts video. And that will appear in these different boxes. You can just simply choose a different slide and picture. And then make sure that's not made for kids as well. And then I'm just guiding you through the process. You can possibly do the tags as well. Video language you want to attach it to subtitles and things of that nature. And then I will guide you through the process next. You click on next and then you can add subtitles if you would like. And then end screen and cards are optional when it comes to the shorts adding that and uploading that through your computer. And then you go to next. And then once you get to visibility, you want to make sure it is set to unlisted. Anytime you do upload a video whether it's shorter or longer version, you want to make sure it is set to unlisted. And then you click on save. And then once you're actually ready to actually publish it, then you set it to actually public. And then you from there you can actually save it as well. And then I also want to show you another cool trick as well that might actually come in handy for your audience members. So after you actually successfully uploaded it public, you made your shorts public. Then you can also go to the left to customization on the left side of the screen in YouTube studio. And then you can also add your shorts from your computer through a section. And that is a really cool trick as well. Just makes everything really neat, organized and structured that way. So I hope you found today's video very helpful and
